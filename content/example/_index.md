## Zones.

Logical boundaries for physical spaces. Everything is scoped: buildings, levels, rooms. Zones allow you to apply rules, visualize usage, and automate outcomes at the right scale.

## Hierarchy.

A structured system where zones contain modules, modules expose functions, and interfaces let people or systems interact. Everything belongs somewhere.

## Modules.

PlaceOS connects to building systems using modular drivers. Each module exposes a standard API so devices and platforms are controlled the same way—regardless of vendor.

## Inputs & Outputs.

Sensors, schedules, button presses, badge scans—any of these can trigger automation. Outputs can be system actions, device commands, or service integrations.

## Automation.

The real engine behind PlaceOS. You can create rules that act on events, time, context, and state. Run workflows, trigger APIs, or combine multiple outcomes across modules.

## Interfaces.

Custom interfaces for every audience: user dashboards, admin controls, kiosk displays, booking panels. Interfaces are connected to the same real-time engine as the automation layer.

## API for Everything.

Every function in PlaceOS—whether it comes from a driver, automation rule, or UI—is accessible by API. Build your own tools, integrate with anything, or script new behaviors.
